## 📖 API Documentation

### Authentication

The API uses JWT token authentication. First, obtain a token:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/get_token \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "your_email@domain.com", "password": "your_password"}'
```

Use the token in subsequent requests:
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your_jwt_token" http://localhost:8000/endpoint
```

### 🏢 Company Endpoints

#### List Companies
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your_jwt_token" \
  "http://localhost:8000/companies/"
```

#### Add a New Company
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/companies/add/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_jwt_token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "company": "Tech Corp",
    "scname": "TechCorp",
    "website": "https://techcorp.com",
    "description": "Leading technology company"
  }'
```

#### Update Company
```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8000/companies/update/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_jwt_token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "id": 1,
    "company": "Updated Tech Corp",
    "website": "https://newtechcorp.com"
  }'
```

### 💼 Job Endpoints

#### Get Jobs with Filters
```bash
# Get all published jobs
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your_jwt_token" \
  "http://localhost:8000/jobs/get/"

# Filter jobs by company
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your_jwt_token" \
  "http://localhost:8000/jobs/get/?company=1"

# Filter jobs by city and remote options
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your_jwt_token" \
  "http://localhost:8000/jobs/get/?city=Bucharest&remote=true"

# Pagination and sorting
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your_jwt_token" \
  "http://localhost:8000/jobs/get/?page=1&limit=20&sort=created_date"
```

#### Add a Job
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/jobs/add/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_jwt_token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "company": 1,
    "job_title": "Python Developer",
    "job_link": "https://company.com/jobs/python-dev",
    "country": "Romania",
    "city": "Bucharest, Cluj-Napoca",
    "county": "Bucharest, Cluj",
    "remote": "hybrid, full-remote"
  }'
```

#### Publish/Unpublish Job
```bash
# Publish job (makes it searchable)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/jobs/publish/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_jwt_token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"job_id": 123}'
```

#### Synchronize Company Jobs
```bash
# Sync all jobs for a company with Solr search index
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/jobs/sync/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_jwt_token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"company": 1}'
```

### Python API Examples

```python
import requests

# Configuration
API_BASE = "http://localhost:8000"
TOKEN = "your_jwt_token"
HEADERS = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {TOKEN}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

# Get companies
response = requests.get(f"{API_BASE}/companies/", headers=HEADERS)
companies = response.json()

    "country": "Romania",
    "city": "Bucharest",
    "county": "Bucharest",
    "remote": "hybrid"
}
response = requests.post(f"{API_BASE}/jobs/add/", json=job_data, headers=HEADERS)

# Search jobs with filters
params = {
    "city": "Bucharest",
    "remote": "true",
    "company": 1,
    "page": 1,
    "limit": 20
}
response = requests.get(f"{API_BASE}/jobs/get/", params=params, headers=HEADERS)
jobs = response.json()

### Key Models

#### Company Model (`company/models.py`)
- **Company**: Main company entity with name, website, description
- **Source**: Data source tracking for companies
- **DataSet**: Historical job count data for companies

#### Job Model (`jobs/models.py`)
- **Job**: Core job entity with title, link, location, company relationship
- Integrates with Solr search engine for real-time search
- Supports publish/unpublish workflow
- Automatic ID generation using MD5 hash of job link

#### User Model (`users/models.py`)
- **CustomUser**: Extends Django's AbstractBaseUser
- Email-based authentication
- Many-to-many relationships with companies
- Automatic superuser permissions for all companies

## 🧪 Testing

This project includes comprehensive automated tests for all Django apps to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.

### Running Tests Locally

#### Option 1: Using Django's built-in test runner

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd scraper_Api

# Set the test settings
export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=scraper_Api.test_settings

# Run all tests
python manage.py test

# Run tests with verbose output
python manage.py test --verbosity=2

# Run specific app tests
python manage.py test users
python manage.py test company

# Run specific test classes
python manage.py test users.tests.CustomUserModelTest
```

#### Option 2: Using pytest

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd scraper_Api

# Run all tests with pytest
python -m pytest

# Run with verbose output
python -m pytest -v

# Run specific tests
python -m pytest users/tests.py -v
```

### Running Tests with Coverage

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd scraper_Api

# Run tests with coverage measurement
export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=scraper_Api.test_settings
python -m coverage run --source='.' manage.py test

# Generate coverage report
python -m coverage report

# Generate HTML coverage report
python -m coverage html
# Open htmlcov/index.html in your browser

# Generate XML coverage report (for CI/CD)
python -m coverage xml
```

### Test Structure

The project includes tests for:

- **Models**: Validation, relationships, constraints, and business logic
- **Views**: API endpoints, authentication, and response handling  
- **Forms**: Data validation and processing
- **Managers**: Custom user management functionality
- **Middleware**: Rate limiting and request processing
- **Background tasks**: Newsletter sending and scheduled operations
- **WebSocket consumers**: Real-time notifications (when channels is available)

### Current Test Coverage

- **Overall**: 33% code coverage
- **Models**: 80%+ coverage on critical business logic
- **User Management**: 95% coverage
- **Job Models**: 81% coverage including Solr integration

### Test Configuration

Tests use a separate configuration (`scraper_Api.test_settings.py`) that:

- Uses SQLite in-memory database for speed
- Disables migrations for faster test execution
- Mocks external services (Solr, Redis, Email)
- Uses simplified authentication for testing
- Provides minimal URL configuration
